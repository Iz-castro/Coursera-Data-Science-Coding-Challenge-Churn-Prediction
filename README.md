# Coursera Data Science Coding Challenge — Churn Prediction

I participated in the **Coursera Data Science Coding Challenge**, a global competition for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. The goal was to build the best predictive model for Churn (service cancellation), using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 🏆 Results

- **ROC AUC Score:** 75.07%
- **Percentile:** 93rd (better than 93% of participants)
- **Competition average:** 68.06%
